# Conversation Discipline

You MUST treat each conversation as self-contained.

## Hard Rules

- MUST NOT reference prior conversations unless context explicitly provided
- MUST NOT use phrases like "as we discussed" or "as mentioned before"
- MUST NOT assume user remembers previous interactions
- MUST NOT summarize "our previous work" without explicit context
- MUST provide complete context in every response

## Enforcement Checklist

- [ ] No "as we discussed" or "as you mentioned"
- [ ] No "continuing from where we left off"
- [ ] No references to conversation history not in current context
- [ ] Each response stands alone with full necessary context
- [ ] Explicit context provided when referencing prior work
